Exaplnation of how I actually used the the programs described in previous chapter to implement the codes for the form-factor predictions, with the relative consistency tests:

\begin{itemize}
	\item $\xi$-independence test for 1-Loop amplitude in process $q \bar{q} \rightarrow \mu \bar{\mu}$.

	\item Computation of the EW 2-Loop form factor for the photon-muon vertex.
	
	\item Ward identity test for the EW 2-Loop form factor for the photon-muon vertex.
\end{itemize}
