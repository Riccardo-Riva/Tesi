Brief introduction of Quantum Field Theory, which allow us to formulate our theories of fundamental interactions of particles in terms of fields. This leads us to obtain predictions of \textit{scattering amplitudes} and \textit{cross sections} for collider physical processes. \\
Description of perturbative method of calculation in terms of Feynman diagrams and description of the loop integrals appearing in \textit{beyond-the-leading-order predictions}.\\


Description of a Gauge Field Theory and the perturbative methods in these kind of theories, with the gauge-fixing. Description of the Electroweak Interaction in terms of gauge theory.
Description the Background Field method for the EW Gauge Theory.\\


Description of the \textit{photon-fermion form factor}. The goal of the thesis is the NNLO 2-Loop computation of the photon-fermion form factor in the Electroweak Interaction.\\


Description of the methods to perform the computation: Express the loop integrals in terms of Scalar Integrals (Passarino-Veltman method) and reduce this set of integrals to a set of Master Integrals.\\ 

Description of some QFT results, useful to test our predictions:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Independence of the results from the gauge-fixing parameter.
	\item Ward Identity for the scattering amplitude:
\end{itemize}
